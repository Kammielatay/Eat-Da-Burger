# Eat-Da-Burger

## Description

In this project, I created a burger logger for the hungry individual. This application allows users to input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the application will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. When the user clicks the "Devour it!" button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This application stores every burger into a database, whether devoured or not! Check it out here on [Heroku](https://thawing-tor-24078.herokuapp.com/) and log the burger you would like to devour.
